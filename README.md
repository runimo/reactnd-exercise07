This was an exercise in the Udacity React Nanodegree.

The task was to build a simple video game website where it is possible to add users and display users, along with the number of games they have played. Additionally, I decided to display the favorite games of the already existing users.

While the user has not filled out all form fields yet, the 'Add' button is disabled.
If the user tries to create a user with a username of an existing user, an error message is displayed.
If the user creates a new user, a success message is displayed.

Additionally, I decided to sort the users so that the newly added user would appear on top of the list, to show the user that it has indeed successfully been created.

The website should also have a button that lets us toggle between showing and hiding the number of games the users have played as well as their favorite games.

The underlying goal of this exercise was to practice the concept of state in React and how state is communicated between components.
